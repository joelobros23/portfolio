        <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
        I'm Joelo Laberinto. I am a Graphic Designer, Web Designer & Video Editor. <br>
        All my skills in Graphic Design, Web Developing and Photoshop editing, <br>
         i learned it all of since when i was High school not in College. <br>
        
        Making Designs is my passion. Art is my passion.<br>
        
        I am not just a Graphic Designer, I'm a Graphic Artist. And there is a <br>
        Huge Difference between a Graphic Designer and Graphic Artist. <br>
        
        For me, i am an inborn artist or Art is already in my blood. <br>
        
        Since when i was a Kid, i already performing some kind of arts such as painting, <br>
         Drawing, and Playing Instruments. <br>

        This means being an Inborn Artist has a huge amount of Creativity and Patience <br>
         & can do Digital Illustrations. <br>
        
        I don't have a Degree or Certificate in Art but like what i said, i am an <br>
        inborn Artist and Art is just my talent. <br>
        
        I'm not a Degree Holder but, Just take time to look at my Designs. <br>
